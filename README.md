A library for calculating the perceptual difference between colors (âˆ†E). 

The difference or distance between two colors is a metric of interest in color science. It allows quantified examination of a notion that formerly could only be described with adjectives. Quantification of these properties is of great importance to those whose work is color-critical. Common definitions make use of the Euclidean distance in a device independent color space.

The following measurements are supported:

- DIN99 (2007)
- CIE76 (1976)
- CIE94 (1994)
- CIEDE2000 (2000)
- CMC l:c (1984)

All calculations are performed in either L\*a\*b* or L\*C\*H* space (as the metrics prescribe).

## Quick Start
This library is available on packagist, like so:
```shell
composer require itwmw/color-difference
```

## Usage
The color difference metrics are implemented via the following functions:

- Din99 `getDifferenceDin99(Color $color): float`
- CIE76: `getDifferenceCIE76(Color $color): float`
- CIE94: `getDifferenceCIE94(Color $color, CIE94 $type = CIE94::GraphicArts): float`
- CIEDE2000: `getDifferenceCIEDE2000(Color $color): float`
- CMC l:c: `getDifferenceCMC(Color $color, CMC $type = CMC::Imperceptibility): float`

```php
use Itwmw\ColorDifference\Color;
use Itwmw\ColorDifference\Lib\RGB;
use Itwmw\ColorDifference\Support\CIE94;
use Itwmw\ColorDifference\Support\CMC;

$color  = new Color(new RGB(255, 183, 255));
$color2 = new Color(new RGB(55, 65, 53));
echo('Din99:' . $color->getDifferenceDin99($color2) . "\n");
echo('CIE76:' . $color->getDifferenceCIE76($color2) . "\n");
echo('CIE94-GraphicArts:' . $color->getDifferenceCIE94($color2, CIE94::GraphicArts) . "\n");
echo('CIE94-Textiles:' . $color->getDifferenceCIE94($color2, CIE94::Textiles) . "\n");
echo('CMC-Acceptability:' . $color->getDifferenceCMC($color2, CMC::Acceptability) . "\n");
echo('CMC-Imperceptibility:' . $color->getDifferenceCMC($color2, CMC::Imperceptibility) . "\n");
echo('CIEDE2000:' . $color->getDifferenceCIEDE2000($color2) . "\n");
```

CIE94 and CMC l:c accept an optional parameter adjusting the metric for the kind of quasimetric being evaluated. CIE94 offers an application type choice of either 'graphicArts' or 'textiles' for their eponymous use. CMC l:c offers a threshold choice of either 'acceptability' or 'imperceptibility' that nuances the just-noticeable difference between the colors.
